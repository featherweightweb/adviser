# Adviser.js

Simple, configurable, form validation plugin for jQuery.

## Install

The easiest way to get started is by installing with bower:
```
bower install adviser
```

Or, you can download the zip/tar archive from the releases section of this repo.

You'll need to include the jQuery (or soon Zepto) library in your webpage before including this script.

## Docs

Proper documentation on the way, but for now, take a quick read of the source! There's plenty of comments to guide you in using adviser.

## Contributing and Issues

This is a beta so don't expect to use this in production without a hiccup or two. If you find a bug or want to suggest an improvment, make a new topic in the issues section. Pull requests are of course always welcome!

## Credit

Credit goes out to the awesome folks at Zurb (makers of Foundation), their client-side form validation plugin `abide` provided the inspiration and style for this project.
